# Sand Table File Preview - Polar Plot

I wanted a way to view .thr files that are used for kinetic art sand tables, I knew it could probably be done in JS but couldn't find anything.

I was going to write it myself but it would've took me a while as I'm no JS expert but thankfully as part of the web interface for the [Dune Weaver](https://makerworld.com/en/models/841332#profileId-787553) sand table they had already made one, so the code is taken from [there](https://github.com/tuanchris/dune-weaver/blob/main/templates/index.html).

This is a standalone one that simply runs in the browser, entirely client side.
